# Playfair Cipher Algorithm

A simple Python implementation of the classic Playfair cipher using a 5x5 matrix. This program allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt text using a custom key.

## Features

- **Encrypt:** Convert plaintext into Playfair ciphertext.
- **Decrypt:** Decode Playfair ciphertext back into readable text.
- **Matrix Visualization:** Displays the 5x5 Playfair matrix generated by your key.

## Files Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application containing the interactive CLI menu.
- `encrypt.py`: Contains the logic for creating the Playfair matrix and encrypting plaintext.
- `decrypt.py`: Contains the logic for decrypting ciphertext via the same matrix rules.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have python installed on your system.
2. Run the main file from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to choose either encryption or decryption.

## Example Usage
